## Description
This project has used some base classes which were developed by me. Which can be extended and develop on top of that. Supports MVVM-C Architecture and UI binding is powered by [RxSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift). The main purpose of this base classes is to develop efficient architecture for the applications and to reduce as much as development time.

## Tasks
All of the tasks were not possible to be completed with four hours. Hence I didn't try to use the given backend. Instead I developed mock services. My main forcus was on login functionality.

#### Login functionality
- [x] Add a login screen to authenticate a user with the application - Needed Input fields: Username & Password and a Button
- [x] The logged-in session needs to be stored - The form of the Session will be a JWT-Token
- [x] Add Logout capabilities
- [x] Facebook login

#### Dashboard
- [x] Job list with pagination
- [x] Job search capabilities - patialy implemented (With mock data cannot see search results are updating) 
- [x] Job details screen
- [ ] In Job detail screen, option to apply, with an indicator that indicated if already applied

#### Profile
- [x] Candidate client API was developed for this feature
- [ ] Profile details, Edit profile attributes (for example name, years of experience)
- [ ] Tab for `Show My Applications`, which should show all the current authenticated users applications. Once tapped it will navigate to Job details screen
- [ ] Password Change Capabilities

#### Additional Demo - To demonstrate actual API calling
- [x] I hava added previously developed Demo dashboard with some functionalities
- [x] In this example it consuming open News APIs
- [x] To enable this functionality, go to `/Views/Coordinators/MainCoordinator/Main_Coordinator.swift` and see line #52

## Architectural components
- [x] Base MVVM-Coodinator architecture.
- [x] Base Table view controller & Base Collection view controller that adopts to MVVM architecture.
- [x] Base Table View Controller and Base Collection View Controller supports,
  - API Pagination,
  - Search,
  - Multiple list views & grid views in one screen,
  - Can hanlde the UI when the table view is empty,
  - Static data loading,
  - Section headers (Dynemic and custom).
  - Can eliminate all the boilerplate code and you only have to customise your rendering UITableViewCell/UICollectionViewCell (which extends from BaseTVCell/BaseCVCell) with the data Model (which extends from BaseModel).

## Reusable components
- [x] Facebook SignIn - Social sign in capability with these protocols and there default implementations. Adopts to Base MVVM architecture.
- [x] NCTabView
  - Tab view that has used in News Example Dashboard.
  - Has three tab selection styles (Bigger Text when highlighted, Underlined when highlighted, Circle background when highlighted).
  - Extendable to have more styles.

## Requirements:
- [x] Xcode Version 10.3 (Developed on Xcode 14.3.1)
- [x] Swift 5
- [x] iOS Version 11.0 or above
- [x] Password to unzip the project. I have shared this with the email


 ## Running Xcode Project and General changes
 - Unzip the Seek.zip to extract the xcode project
 - Open the project(.xcworkspace file) in Xcode
 - Now you can simply run the project in simulator
 - Do a pod install if necessary

## Use this test account to Sign in with Facebook
 - E-mail: "johndoe20220518@gmail.com"
 - Password: "johnDoe20220518."
 - In case if a sequrity check pops up, you might want to login to the gmail first. For 2-step auth, you can use '5029 2893' or '5705 5746'. Password would be same. 
  
## Project Architecture and Related details

Specifics                 | Details
--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Architecture - MVVM-C   | Used RxSwift to bind View and ViewModel. Coodinators are responsible for navigation flow.
| Base classes            | `Common/Components`, `Common/Architectural` folders - All the base & generic classes & Re-usable common components reside within this folder. All the other classes are inherited from the classes which are within this folders
| Networking - Alamofire  | `Network` folders<br/>- `Common\Network\HTTPService.swift` - Actual network reqeust handling<br/>- `Common\Network\HTTPMockService.swift` - mock network reqeust handling<br/>- `Network\APIProtocols` folder - API definitions that the App will be consume. <br/>
| Models                  | `Models` folder - All the models used by the app reside within this folder. Almost all the models which are passed by the Network Services are extending `BaseModel` class
| Views                   | `Views` folder - All the UI elements reside within this folder. (Storyboards, ViewControllers, ViewModels, App TableView Cells)
| App Config                 | Used a simple Singleton class to keep the configuration parameters. Most of the values that are used by AppConfig are stored in `Configuration.plist`
